# Nursery Rhyme Five Little Ducks
### Coding exercise
<p>I created this simple java program to revise the use of logic, conditional statements and loops.</p>
<p>It simply executes the full five verses of the song but with the use of variables to replace the number of ducks.

### Five Little Ducks

<p><i>5 little ducks went swimming one day <br>
Over the hill and far away <br>
Mother duck said, “Quack quack quack quack” <br>
And only 4 little ducks came back!
